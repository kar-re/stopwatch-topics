# Stopwatch topics
Stopwatch topics is an easy way of tracking what you're spending your time on. 
It is powered by SvelteKit and was a way for me to learn a bit more about Svelte.

You can find it live on (https://stopwatch-topics.pages.dev/)[https://stopwatch-topics.pages.dev/]. 

## Background
I've tried numerous pomodoro apps but they never kind of worked for me. One thing that did tho was visualizing what I'm currently spending my time on, and kind of guilt tripping me into doing something more productive. A pause in a pomodoro session quickly spiraled into two hours, while stopwatch-topics shows it to you.

## Reflections
Svelte is really nice to work with. Cloudflare pages is also painless.
